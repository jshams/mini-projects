# Fibonacci Timer
In this project, I used various methods to get fibonacci numbers and
compared their times. I also used matplotlib to plot the times of
different methods.

## See the [Jupyter Notebook](fibonacci_times.ipynb)
The jupyter notebook walks through various methods with descriptions,
and tells the story of my fib discoveries.
