# Jony Ive Tweet Generator

Jony Ive, who is known mainly for his work as the Chief Desin Officer of Apple,
is also known for narrating several of Apple's design videos. His soothing
voice, British tone, and well articulated descriptions make the products seem
that much better.

In Jony Ive Tweet Gen, I have created a Markov Model that has analyzed text
from dozens of Apple's design videos featuring Jony Ive for generating fake
sentences that sound like they could've come from Ive himself.

## Assignment

This was created as an assignment for my CS1.2 class at
[Make School](https://makeschool.com). The project was to build a tweet
generator utilizing any large corpus. I chose to base mine off of Jony
Ive. The assignment builds on the data structures taught throughout the
course.
