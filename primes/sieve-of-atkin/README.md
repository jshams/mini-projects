# Sieve of Atkin
The sieve of Atkin is a modern algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a
specified integer. Compared with the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, which
marks off multiples of primes, the sieve of Atkin does some preliminary work
and then marks off multiples of squares of primes, thus achieving a better
theoretical asymptotic complexity. It was created in 2003 by A. O. L. Atkin
and Daniel J. Bernstein.


## Implementation:
This sieve was implemeted in Python.
