# Sliding Puzzle Solver
Sliding Puzzles also known as 9 Puzzle 15 Puzzle or 24 Puzzle are a classic
game from the late 19th century. This solver works using breadth first search.
It works by trying all possible routes from a beginning state, and searches
new states one layer at a time till it finds a solution, this is also the
optimal solution.

## Larger Project
Although this began as a mini project, I took it further to make a playable game
with a solve button that uses a similar algorithm to solve.
