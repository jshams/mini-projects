# How Long Has it Been?
Due to the novel coronavirus Covid-19, many of us have been forced to stay 
inside. This site aims to remind you how long it's been that you're stuck in
quarantine. Find out how long you've been stuck in quarantine at
[How Long Has it Been](https://jshams.github.io/how-long-has-it-been/).
Change your location by clicking on the state.


## Version 1.10
In the first version of How Long Has it Been users can see how long they've
been stuck in quarantine, and chose their location by state (in the US) and
see how long they have been stuck in quarantine.
